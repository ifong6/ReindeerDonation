## Introduction

Reindeer is a non-profit gift donation platform dedicated to making children's wishes come true. By leveraging community support and technology, Reindeer connects donors with children in need to provide them with gifts during the holiday season and beyond. Our mission is to bring joy and hope to as many children as possible through the simple act of giving.

## Project Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]. The application is part of our initiative to streamline the process of gift matching and delivery through a robust, user-friendly web platform.

## Getting Started

To begin development, first run the server using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you make changes to the file.

This project is configured with [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, enhancing the visual aesthetics and readability.
